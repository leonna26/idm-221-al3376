### **Document Inspiration**:

For my site inspiration, I looked at various websites of nonprofits to look at how they told their story and engaged visitors to volunteer/take part in their cause. 

1. Goodwill - https://www.goodwill.org/ I like how the home page has interactive image bubbles that grow bigger when hovered. The image shows a description and is clickable when you hover it. I like this way of showing different topics instead of blocks of text as a way to direct the site visitor to the appropriate pages. It makes it engaging and interactive.
2. That's Not Cool - https://thatsnotcool.com/ This is a very cool website. I'm not sure what this feature is called (if it has a name), but the site utilizes some sort of flipboard effect with each scroll, and includes animations that bring text and images in. It is very engaging and unique. I love how it eases the amount of reading the site visitor does on the site - instead, it feels like the visitor is taken through a story sequence while learning about the organization/cause. 
3. Big Brothers Big Sisters of America - https://www.bbbs.org/ I like that opening this site brings visitors immediately in to what the organization stands for, showing video clips of children that the organization has impacted along with text to tell a story. It's as if landing on the home page starts a video on autoplay, except that it stretches the entire upper fold of the site. This is dynamic and captures its missions and values effectively. Then visitors scroll slightly and there are two buttons - "get involved" and "donate," both of which are great transitions after the tie-in/hook.
