            <h1> About </h1>
            We are seeing the emergence of China as one of the most powerful nations on earth. What kind of influence will China have upon the world, and how will its relationship with the West develop?
            A nation is not transformed simply by changes in policies, technology, or even economic welfare, but rather through <i>individuals being transformed.</i> In the decades ahead, the future of every nation will be affected by the future of China -- but for this impact to be a positive one, China must witness its next generation of leaders being transformed into people of vision, integrity, and altruism.

            <h2> History </h2>
            <strong><i>ISEC (Intercollegiate Summer English Camps)</i></strong>, a social enterprise in partnership with educational and non-profit organizations, has provided educational services to thousands of Chinese youth throughout China.
            
            ISEC was first established in 1999 as a student society at Oxford University. Originally a group of ten teachers, since then over five hundred top Western university students have participated. ISEC has held camps in fourteen provinces China and more than 20,000 Chinese primary, secondary, and university students have benefited from our programs. 
            
            ISEC has worked in partnership with a number of groups, including educational organizations such as China Society of Education Training Center, Root Education, and Yangzhou Educational Service Center, and non-profit organizations such as Beijing UNESCO, Soong Ching Ling Foundation, Communist Youth League, Town and Talent, and Chinese Society of Education.
