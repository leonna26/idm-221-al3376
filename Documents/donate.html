        ISEC would not be possible without the help of its financial supporters. We deeply appreciate the generous support of alumni and partner fellowships that make it possible for ISEC to continue in its services.
        <br>
        <h2>To Support a Volunteer</h2>
        ISEC fully covers food, accommodation, travel, training, and other program-related expenses in China. 
        <br>
        However, volunteers are expected to pay for their own:
        <ul>
              <li>flights</li>
              <li>visas</li>
              <li>travel insurance</li>
        </ul>
        If you would like to support an ISEC volunteer, please use the form below to make a donation. Make sure to include the name of the volunteer, or write “Any” to donate to whichever volunteers are most in need. Volunteers are only reimbursed for their actual expenses. Any donations exceeding a volunteer’s actual expenses will be shared among any other volunteers still in need. The ISEC program itself does not receive any funding from donations designated for teachers. If you would like to make a donation to the ISEC program directly, please write “ISEC-General” under the teacher name. 
        <br>
        All donations are tax-deductible for US donors. Anyone may donate using the form below, but we are unable to provide documentation for tax-free donations outside the US. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions using the contact form.
