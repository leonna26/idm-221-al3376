            <h2>Program Overview</h2>
            <b>COST:</b> FREE! 
            <br>
            You cover the costs of getting to China: flights, visa, and health insurance. The program intends to cover the cost of transportation, food, and accommodation within China. However, a small contribution towards these costs may be required – if so, ISECers will be informed in advance at the earliest opportunity.
