       ISEC stands for  <strong><i>Intercollegiate Summer English Camps.</i></strong> It was originally a group of ten teachers, and first established in 1999 as a student society at Oxford University. Since then over 500 top Western university students have participated.
       <br>
       <br>
       Over the years, ISEC has held camps in 14 provinces in China and more than 20,000 Chinese primary, secondary, and university students have benefited from our programs.
      <br>
      <br>
       ISEC has worked in partnership with a number groups, including educational organizations such as China Society of Education Training Center, Root Education, and Yangzhou Educational Service Center, and non-profit organizations such as Beijing UNESCO, Soong Ching Ling Foundation, Communist Youth League, Town and Talent, and Chinese Society of Education.
