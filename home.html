            <h1> Welcome </h1>
            We are seeing the emergence of China as one of the most powerful nations on earth. What kind of influence will China have upon the world, and how will its relationship with the West develop?
            A nation is not transformed simply by changes in policies, technology, or even economic welfare, but rather through <i>individuals being transformed.</i> In the decades ahead, the future of every nation will be affected by the future of China -- but for this impact to be a positive one, China must witness its next generation of leaders being transformed into people of vision, integrity, and altruism.
